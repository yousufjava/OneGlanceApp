**One Glance** is a minimalist health tracking app designed to simplify where your health stands at a glance.

## ðŸ§­ Why One Glance?

> â€œI started this idea with the purpose of simplifying where your health stands compared to the general population. Health apps today often overwhelm users with data, creating a high barrier to entry for everyday people.

This app aims to reduce that friction by providing a single, digestible wellness metric. Users can expand into more details only if they choose to making the experience empowering instead of overwhelming.

Iâ€™ve intentionally structured the app to be scalable, with future plans to integrate Apple and Google Health APIs, and to use LLMs for personalized recommendations that feel human, not robotic.

A great deal of time has gone into crafting a minimalist landing page, calming animations, and intuitive interactions to create an inviting, non-judgmental space to reflect on your well-being.

Thereâ€™s still much to build, but this is the foundation Iâ€™m proud to share.
